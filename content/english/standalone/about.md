Meta Mesh Wireless Communities is a non-profit Internet Service Provider. We attack the Digital Divide in the Greater Pittsburgh area by helping those who cannot afford or depend on their existing Internet Services. To do this, we raise grant funds and works with community groups, universities, and school districts to cover the cost of services.

Our goal is to get broadband Internet to Pittsburghers who need it, without burdening them with a monthly bill.

_This approach has never been done before on a city-wide scale in the US!_

## Our Mission

To bridge the Digital Divide in a meaningful and permanent way by building Community Wireless Networks in Pittsburgh and around the world.

In our own city of Pittsburgh, nearly 23% of people do not have Internet access. To live and work in today's digital society, it is essential to have access to the Internet. Reliable Internet access is no longer a luxury – it is a necessity, and a right.

To bridge the Digital Divide we need to achieve three main goals:

1. **Build the United States' _first and largest_ community-based WiFi network**. By building an exemplary network here in Pittsburgh, we can show others around the United States (and the world) that they can build _and own_ their Internet distribution networks without paying exorbitant fees. Check out a [side-by-side comparison](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18bi9M0zQGHv3DZgx3uXPMUD--TEUzGsr/view?usp=sharing) of our mesh/WISP model next to incumbent ISPs’ approach.
2. **Build the United States' _best_ community-based WiFi network.** What good is a network if it doesn't work well or benefit the local community? We strive to build a fast, reliable, and expansive network to get Internet access to as many people as possible. In addition to Internet access, a local “intranet” can host websites and services that enable communication even if the greater Internet goes down. The Meta Mesh Network can support community message boards, local chat programs, ebook libraries, and emergency notification systems. Meta Mesh is developing open-source resources to improve these community-specific benefits.
3. **Be an example and a resource to others.** This means sharing our knowledge and engaging those who need to build their own WiFi network. Meta Mesh is dedicated to creating high-quality educational and administrative resources that can be used freely by anyone, anywhere in order to build networks like ours. You can also view some of our classes on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/metameshwc).

## Our Vision

A Pittsburgh where everyone has affordable and reliable access to the Internet.

## Our Values

* **Inclusion** -- We support people in underserved communities by addressing the critical need for affordable Internet access. We also created a [glossary of terms](https://www.metamesh.org/more/) and FAQ section to translate “tech talk” into concepts that everyone can understand.
* **Transparency** -- We ensure the public can view our progress and see metrics of our success on our [live map](https://www.pittmesh.net/).
* **Stewardship** -- We organize existing neighborhood resources to maintain and monitor good connectivity for the public benefit.
* **Equity** -- We embody equal opportunity through a not-for-profit model that requires low up-front investment from communities and low monthly fees for individual households. The income from these costs goes directly back into the operations of our organization to maintain and expand the network.
* **Sustainability** -- We develop and install a complete Internet connectivity solution for our neighbors’ needs. We gather grant funds for the initial build-out, and then we assist neighborhoods in creating sustainable community-oriented methods for covering any [maintenance costs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cP9_ZUdOomZx-FlmuC0weh0V2gCRi9S3/view?usp=sharing) that arise after installation.
* **Empowerment** -- We share our knowledge by creating high-quality educational and administrative resources that can be used freely by anyone to build their own WiFi network.

## Partnerships

[In May of 2020](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2020/may/meta-mesh.html), Meta Mesh partnered with Carnegie Mellon University’s Sustaining Equitable Education Network [(SEEN)](https://www.cmu.edu/seen/). SEEN is “_focused on first helping high-need K-12 schools make a successful transition to remote learning through emergency relief, and then continuing partnerships with those schools and communities to invest in equitable new educational systems post-COVID-19_”.

Through this partnership, Meta Mesh and SEEN have secured an invaluable opportunity: to mount WiFi equipment on the top of the University of Pittsburgh’s Cathedral of Learning. This high point location allows us to broadcast across farther distances, reaching areas of Pittsburgh we could not reach before. We've also partnered with [KINBER](https://kinber.org/), who is providing the Cathedral's gateway to the Internet. Taken as a whole, this site will act as our main “hub,” enabling us to expand our network and work towards delivering on our mission.

Thanks to this new opportunity, we are currently working to get Internet access to the areas of New Kensington-Arnold School District, Cornell School District, and Homewood. More information on the procedures and equipment used for these projects is available on the tech resources page.

We are honored by the number of interested parties who contacted us about setting up their own projects with Meta Mesh. Please reach out if you are interested in what we do and want to explore options for connecting your area. New partnerships will be announced on this page.
