(Nov. 9, 2020) &ndash; In a historic collaborative effort, Meta Mesh Wireless Communities, Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh, and the Keystone Initiative for Network-based Research (KINBER) have partnered together to provide free, high-speed Internet access primarily to school-age children as the COVID-19 pandemic forces the integration of remote instruction.</p><p>“To live and work in today’s digital society, it is essential to have access to the Internet. Reliable Internet access is no longer a luxury – it is a necessity and a right. Unfortunately, many people in our own City of Pittsburgh cannot afford the Internet services they need. <em>Every1online</em> is a one way to begin to see Internet access as a human right,” said Adam Longwill, Executive Director of Meta Mesh Wireless Communities.</p><p>Designed to create more equitable access to the internet, <em>Every1online</em> will provide WiFi at no cost to eligible households during a 12-month pilot program in the Coraopolis, Homewood and New Kensington areas—with the goal of expanding the program to additional communities in Western Pennsylvania beyond the first year. As the first non-profit wireless Internet model in the country, the project seeks to shrink the Digital Divide by prioritizing Pittsburghers in-need.</p><p>“This kind of inter-organizational collaboration, where large institutions and community organizations come together to solve complex, pressing challenges together, is essential for developing meaningful, impactful solutions. We are so thrilled to be a part of this collaborative and to have this chance to make real change in our city” said Maggie Hannan, Associate Director of CMU&rsquo;s <a href=https://www.cmu.edu/simon/>Simon Initiative</a>.</p><p>Pitt’s Vice Chancellor and CIO Mark Henderson added “This partnership will no doubt have a meaningful impact on bridging the digital divide in communities that are literally within view of the iconic Cathedral of Learning. We’re grateful for the opportunity to contribute to improving educational outcomes in these school districts, and the resulting long-term benefits for the region.”</p><p>The <em>Every1online</em> plan is to build a Community Wireless Network that provides high-speed broadband Internet, which is optimal for simultaneous video conferences. While the pilot program seeks to prioritize households with students, any household within the service area can sign-up to receive in-home equipment and connect to the network. Visit <a href=https://www.metamesh.org/projects/ title=https://www.metamesh.org/projects/>https://www.metamesh.org/projects/</a> for more details and registration, which is available today through Jan. 31, 2021.</p><p>“So many of our students live in poverty, or other circumstances that prevent them from having access to high-speed Internet, which is what they need to learn remotely. This collaboration is really making the statement that these kids deserve equitable Internet access,” said Kris Hupp, the Cornell School District’s director of Technology and Instructional Innovation. “My hope is that, through <em>Every1online</em>, I will have a solution for our families&ndash;just like breakfast and school lunches, if we have a hungry kid, we’ll feed them. And if we have a kid who needs Internet, we can provide <em>Every1online</em>.”</p><p>With generous support from the Hopper Dean Foundation, the RK Mellon Foundation, the Bernita Buncher Educational Advancement Fund of The Pittsburgh Foundation, and the Burrell-New Kensington Rotary Club, <em>Every1online</em> is made possible by:</p><p>· <strong>Meta Mesh Wireless Communities (MMWC)</strong>: MMWC is a nonprofit organization that is the primary Networking Solutions Consolidator responsible for Network Design, Equipment Installer, and maintenance for the project.</p><p>● <strong>Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)</strong>: A team of collaborators from CMU’s School of Computer Science and the Simon Initiative have coordinated the project connections to CMU and Pitt, provided critical start-up funding for the project and liaise with key stakeholders and community groups. They offer ongoing project design, implementation, and fundraising support.</p><p>&ldquo;COVID-19 did not create the digital divide, but it is highlighting existing inequities in the education system. We&rsquo;re trying to come up with solutions that aren&rsquo;t band-aids. Because what happens after that? We&rsquo;re attempting to create a solution that doesn&rsquo;t go away - that sustainably alleviates a systemic problem,&rdquo; said Ashley Williams Patton, Director of Carnegie Mellon University&rsquo;s Computer Science Pathways program.</p><p>● <strong>University of Pittsburgh (Pitt)</strong>: Pitt IT and the Chief Information Officer along with Community & Governmental Relations are key stakeholders and integral collaborators. The University is contributing facility access and funding to enable use of the Cathedral of Learning as the “Super Node/hub.” With its extensive community engagement efforts, including centers in Homewood and the Hill District, Pitt also will support stakeholder and community involvement in additional neighborhoods following the pilot.</p><p>● <strong>The Keystone Initiative for Network Based Education and Research (KINBER):</strong> KINBER is Pennsylvania’s statewide research, education, and community network organization and network provider to both CMU and Pitt and will provide a “gateway” to the Internet through KINBER’s PennREN Fiber to be broadcasted from the Cathedral of Learning via MetaMesh.</p><p>“KINBER is pleased to be supporting this innovative collaborative partnership between our higher education members, local technology partners, and local school districts to provide essential broadband capabilities for students and residents in need in some of western Pennsylvania’s unserved and underserved areas,” said Nathan Flood, KINBER CEO.</p><p>● <strong>Participating School Districts and Community Groups</strong>: The New Kensington-Arnold and Cornell (Coraopolis) school districts, as well as the Homewood Children&rsquo;s Village, are collaborators. Penn State New Kensington also contributes to the project’s progress in the New Kensington area. These local community partners bring vital expertise, leading the effort to build community buy-in, leveraging social capital to facilitate the creation of WISP infrastructure, and identifying households in need of Internet connectivity. They also advise CMU, Pitt, and Meta Mesh partners on community need and intentional partnership practices.</p><p>“The Cities of Arnold and New Kensington have faced significant struggles with the loss of its primary industry, but there is a great deal of hope and potential to be found within the community. I see the Every1online initiative as a sustainable piece of a broader community system that provides it members opportunities to become productive contributors to ongoing growth and success.”</p><p>-Jon Banko, Acting Superintendent of New Kensington-Arnold School District</p><p>**“**The Pandemic has really highlighted that Internet is really not a luxury, it is a basic necessity. Every1online will change so much in our community… it’s a chance for greater equity. It takes collaboration for these things to come together, none of us can do it all on our own. Knowing that there’s different partners coming together gives a greater sense of stability and security—it helps to anchor these initiatives and ensure that partners bring their core strengths to the table.”</p><p>–Walter Lewis, President & CEO of Homewood Children’s Village.</p><p>“Penn State New Kensington has been privileged to work closely with Meta Mesh Wireless Communities, the University of Pittsburgh, CMU, and KINBER to implement this project in the local area. Along with the ongoing revitalization efforts, this particular project will help ensure connectivity for the community and continue strengthening access and future-ready skill sets of students and others. As a parent of children in the New Kensington-Arnold School District, I witnessed first-hand the impact pandemic-related school closures had on my daughters&rsquo; peers and other students who lacked access to reliable digital resources. Every1online will empower all students within our district and help provide a strong pathway to more equitable educational opportunities.”</p><p>- Alyssa Pistininzi, Penn State New Kensington Education Strategy & Planning Manager</p><p><img src=https://www.metamesh.org/images/meta-mesh-team-atop-the-cathedral-of-learning-left-adam-longwill-right-jacob-driggs-1.jpg alt></p><p>Meta Mesh Team Atop The Cathedral of Learning (left: Adam Longwill, right: Jacob Driggs)</p><p><img src=https://www.metamesh.org/images/the-cathedral-of-learning-from-cmu-campus-photo-credit-tom-altany-university-of-pittsburgh-1.JPG alt></p><p>The Cathedral of Learning From CMU Campus (Photo Credit: Tom Altany/University of Pittsburgh)</p><p><strong>About the Partners:</strong></p><p><em>Meta Mesh Wireless Communities</em></p><p>Meta Mesh Wireless Communities (established in 2015) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit Internet Service Provider attacking the Digital Divide in the Greater Pittsburgh areas by helping those who cannot afford or depend on their existing Internet Services.
