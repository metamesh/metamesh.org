MetaMesh is proud to announce the addition of 16 new [Wireless Access
Points](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point) ("WAPs") to
the [PittMesh](http://pittmesh.net) family! These WAPs will be located
in the Allentown neighborhood of Pittsburgh, PA along Warrington Ave.
between Arlington Ave. and Beltzhoover Ave.  This 1,400 ft corridor will
serve a community plaza, multiple restaurants and bars, along with other
businesses along the route. [The Hardware
Store](http://workhardpgh.com/), a
[coworking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking) space serving as
Meta Mesh's office, can also be found along the corridor.

These nodes represent the first consumer-oriented deployment of the
PittMesh network, where anyone with a WiFi-capable device can connect to
them with no special equipment or networking knowledge. Simply connect
to the "PittMesh" network, open your favorite web-browser, read and
accept the Terms of Service, and you're connected!  In addition to
mesh-only services in the works, access to the Internet is graciously
provided by Sweet Peaches, the Hardware Store and soon a few other businesses!


MetaMesh is always looking for businesses and individuals who would be
interested in hosting an access point or donating a portion of their
internet connection to help us to expand the capabilities and reach of
PittMesh.  By owning a node, you help fulfill our
[vision](/vision.html) of a decentralized network
with no central points of failure.  The access points are small,
stylish, and use minimal electricity.  For further information, please
[contact](/contact.html) MetaMesh.

Wireless Warrington has been made possible by a generous grant from the
[URA](http://www.ura.org) and the [Mount Washington
CDC](http://mwcdc.org/), the local [Community Development
Corporation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_development_corporation).
Additionally, a special shout-out goes to [The Hardware
Store](http://workhardpgh.com/) and [Sweet
Peaches](https://www.facebook.com/eatsweetpeaches) for their support.
