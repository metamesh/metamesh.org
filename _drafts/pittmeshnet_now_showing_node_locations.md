[PittMesh.net](http://www.pittmesh.net) got a major update today! It is now displaying actual node locations instead of just a number of nodes online. 

![PittMesh.net as of {{post.date}}]()

Moreover, this information is stored in such a way that moving to a truely dynamic, live status display is trivial: we need only change the data source for the node locations to something collecting the information at current instead of using a static file.
