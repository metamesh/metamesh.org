MetaMesh is proud to announce the addition of 16 new [Wireless Access
Points](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point) ("WAPs") to
the [PittMesh](http://pittmesh.net) family! These WAPs will be located
in the Allentown neighborhood of Pittsburgh, PA along Warrington Ave.
between Arlington Ave. and Beltzhoover Ave.  This 1,400 ft corridor will
serve a community plaza, multiple restaurants and bars, along with other
businesses along the route. [The Hardware
Store](http://workhardpgh.com/), a
[coworking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking) space serving as
Meta Mesh's office, can also be found along the corridor.

These nodes represent the first consumer-oriented deployment of the
PittMesh network, where anyone with a WiFi-capable device can connect to
them with no special equipment or networking knowledge. Simply connect
to the "PittMesh" network, open your favorite web-browser, read and
accept the Terms of Service, and you're connected!  In addition to
mesh-only services in the works, access to the Internet is graciously
provided by Sweet Peaches and the Hardware Store, some of the essential
businesses that keep Allentown running.


MetaMesh is always looking for businesses and individuals who would be
interested in hosting an access point or donating a portion of their
internet connection to help us to expand the capabilities and reach of
PittMesh.  By owning a node, you help fulfill our
[vision](/vision.html) of a decentralized network
with no central points of failure.  The access points are small,
stylish, and use minimal electricity.  For further information, please
[contact](/contact.html) MetaMesh.

Wireless Warrington has been made possible by a generous grant from the
[URA](http://www.ura.org) and the [Allentown
CDC](http://www.allentowncdc.org/), the local [Community Development
Corporation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_development_corporation).
Additionally, a special shout-out goes to [The Hardware
Store](http://workhardpgh.com/) and [Sweet
Peaches](https://www.facebook.com/eatsweetpeaches) for their support.
