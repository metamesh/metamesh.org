We bridge the Digital Divide in the Greater Pittsburgh area by helping those who are unable to have Internet access where they live. To do this, we raise funds and work with community groups, universities, and school districts to cover the cost of our services.</p><p>Our goal is to get broadband Internet to Pittsburghers who need it, without burdening them with a monthly bill.</p><p><em>This approach has never been done before on a large scale in the United States!</em></p><h2 id=our-mission>Our Mission</h2><p>To bridge the Digital Divide in a meaningful and permanent way by building Community Wireless Networks in Pittsburgh and around the world.</p><p>In our own city of Pittsburgh, nearly 23% of people do not have Internet access. To live and work in today&rsquo;s digital society, it is essential to have access to the Internet. Reliable Internet access is no longer a luxury – it is a necessity, and a right.</p><p>To bridge the Digital Divide we need to achieve three main goals:</p><ol><li><strong>Build the United States&rsquo; <em>first and largest</em> need-based Community Wireless Internet Service Provider</strong>. By building an exemplary network here in Pittsburgh, we can show others around the United States (and the world) that they can build <em>and own</em> their Internet distribution networks without paying exorbitant fees. By focusing on neighborhoods that need connectivity the most we separate ourselves from for-profit alternatives. Check out a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18bi9M0zQGHv3DZgx3uXPMUD--TEUzGsr/view?usp=sharing">side-by-side comparison</a> of our mesh/WISP model next to incumbent ISPs’ approach.</li><li><strong>Build the United States&rsquo; <em>best</em> community-based WiFi network.</strong> What good is a network if it doesn&rsquo;t work well or benefit the local community? We strive to build a fast, reliable, and expansive network to get Internet access to as many people as possible. In addition to Internet access, a local “intranet” can host websites and services that enable communication even if the greater Internet goes down. The Meta Mesh Network will eventually support services such as community message boards, local chat programs, ebook libraries, and emergency notification systems. Meta Mesh is developing open-source resources to improve these community-specific benefits.</li><li><strong>Be an example and a resource to others.</strong> This means sharing our knowledge and engaging those who need to build their own WiFi networks. Meta Mesh is dedicated to creating high-quality educational and administrative resources that can be used freely by anyone, anywhere in order to build networks like ours. You can also view some of our classes on <a href=https://www.youtube.com/metameshwc>our YouTube channel</a>.</li></ol><p>For more on Meta Mesh Wireless Communities, check out our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cu6Jc8GLfZ_EXWdIFakwAk1OTrphuNqo/view?usp=sharing">2020 Organizational Fact-sheet</a>.</p><h2 id=our-vision>Our Vision</h2><p>A Pittsburgh where everyone has fast, reliable, and private access to the Internet.</p><h2 id=our-values>Our Values</h2><ul><li><strong>Inclusion</strong> &ndash; We support people in underserved communities by addressing the critical need for affordable Internet access. We also created a <a href=https://www.metamesh.org/more/>glossary of terms</a> and FAQ section to translate “tech talk” into concepts that everyone can understand.</li><li><strong>Transparency</strong> &ndash; We ensure the public can view our progress and see metrics of our success on our <a href=https://www.pittmesh.net/>live map</a>.</li><li><strong>Stewardship</strong> &ndash; We organize existing neighborhood resources to maintain and monitor good connectivity for the public benefit.</li><li><strong>Equity</strong> &ndash; We embody equal opportunity through a not-for-profit model that requires low up-front investment from communities and low or no monthly fees for individual households. The income from these costs goes directly back into the operations of our organization to maintain and expand the network.</li><li><strong>Sustainability</strong> &ndash; We develop and install a complete Internet connectivity solution for our neighbors’ needs. We gather grant funds for the initial build-out, and then we assist neighborhoods in creating sustainable community-oriented methods for covering any <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cP9_ZUdOomZx-FlmuC0weh0V2gCRi9S3/view?usp=sharing">maintenance costs</a> that arise after installation.</li><li><strong>Empowerment</strong> &ndash; We share our knowledge by creating high-quality educational and administrative resources that can be used freely by anyone to build their own WiFi network.</li></ul><h2 id=our-team>Our Team</h2><h3 id=adam-longwill----executive-director><strong>Adam Longwill</strong> &ndash; Executive Director</h3><div class="card border-0 rounded-0 mb-3 shadow shortcode user-bio team-member"><div class="row no-gutters pad"><div class="col-lg-3 col-md-4 card-img-box"><img class="card-img-top rounded-0" alt="Portrait of Adam Longwill" src=https://www.metamesh.org/images/team/adam-longwill.jpg></div><div class="col-lg-9 col-md-8"><div class="pt-3 pb-0"><div class=card-text><p>Adam was born in Pittsburgh, went to Woodland Hills, and studied Industrial Design at Philadelphia University before transferring and earning an English degree from Goucher College.

SEEN is “<em>focused on first helping high-need K-12 schools make a successful transition to remote learning through emergency relief, and then continuing partnerships with those schools and communities to invest in equitable new educational systems post-COVID-19</em>”.</p><p>Through this partnership, Meta Mesh and SEEN have secured an invaluable opportunity: to mount cutting edge radio equipment on the top of the University of Pittsburgh’s Cathedral of Learning. This high point location allows us to broadcast across great distances, reaching areas of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County we could not reach before. We&rsquo;ve also partnered with <a href=https://kinber.org/>KINBER</a>, who is providing bandwidth via a high speed fiber backbone. Taken as a whole, this site will act as our main “hub,” enabling us to expand our network and work towards delivering on our mission.</p><p>Thanks to this new opportunity, we are currently working to get Internet access to the areas of New Kensington-Arnold School District, Cornell School District, and Homewood. More information on the procedures and equipment used for these projects is available on the tech resources page.</p><p>We are honored by the number of interested parties who contacted us about setting up their own projects with Meta Mesh. Please reach out if you are interested in what we do and want to explore options for connecting your area.</p></div><div class="social-share pt-4"><h4>Share:</h4><a class=resp-sharing-button__link href="https://facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.metamesh.org%2fabout%2f" target=_blank rel=noopener aria-label><div class="resp-sharing-button resp-sharing-button--facebook resp-sharing-button--small"><div aria-hidden=true class="resp-sharing-button__icon resp-sharing-button__icon--solid"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M18.77 7.46H14.5v-1.9c0-.9.6-1.1 1-1.1h3V.5h-4.33C10.24.5 9.5 3.44 9.5 5.32v2.15h-3v4h3v12h5v-12h3.85l.42-4z"/></svg></div></div></a><a class=resp-sharing-button__link href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?text=Who%20We%20Are&url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.metamesh.org%2fabout%2f" target=_blank rel=noopener aria-label><div class="resp-sharing-button resp-sharing-button--twitter resp-sharing-button--small"><div aria-hidden=true class="resp-sharing-button__icon resp-sharing-button__icon--solid"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M23.44 4.83c-.8.37-1.5.38-2.22.02.93-.56.98-.96 1.32-2.02-.88.52-1.86.9-2.9 1.1-.82-.88-2-1.43-3.3-1.43-2.5.0-4.55 2.04-4.55 4.54.0.36.03.7.1 1.04-3.77-.2-7.12-2-9.36-4.75-.4.67-.6 1.45-.6 2.3.0 1.56.8 2.95 2 3.77-.74-.03-1.44-.23-2.05-.57v.06c0 2.2 1.56 4.03 3.64 4.44-.67.2-1.37.2-2.06.08.58 1.8 2.26 3.12 4.25 3.16C5.78 18.1 3.37 18.74 1 18.46c2 1.3 4.4 2.04 6.97 2.04 8.35.0 12.92-6.92 12.92-12.93.0-.2.0-.4-.02-.6.9-.63 1.96-1.22 2.56-2.14z"/></svg></div></div></a><a class=resp-sharing-button__link href="mailto:?subject=Who%20We%20Are&body=https%3a%2f%2fwww.metamesh.org%2fabout%2f" target=_self rel=noopener aria-label><div class="resp-sharing-button resp-sharing-button--email resp-sharing-button--small"><div aria-hidden=true class="resp-sharing-button__icon resp-sharing-button__icon--solid"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M22 4H2C.9 4 0 4.9.0 6v12c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h20c1.1.0 2-.9 2-2V6c0-1.1-.9-2-2-2zM7.25 14.43l-3.5 2c-.08.05-.17.07-.25.07-.17.0-.34-.1-.43-.25-.14-.24-.06-.55.18-.68l3.5-2c.24-.14.55-.06.68.18.14.24.06.55-.18.68zm4.75.07c-.1.0-.2-.03-.27-.08l-8.5-5.5c-.23-.15-.3-.46-.15-.7.15-.22.46-.3.7-.14L12 13.4l8.23-5.32c.23-.15.54-.08.7.15.14.23.07.54-.16.7l-8.5 5.5c-.08.04-.17.07-.27.07zm8.93 1.75c-.1.16-.26.25-.43.25-.08.0-.17-.02-.25-.07l-3.5-2c-.24-.13-.32-.44-.18-.68s.44-.32.68-.18l3.5 2c.24.13.32.44.18.68z"/></svg></div></div></a></div></div></div></div></section></div><footer id=footer class=section-bg><div class=container><div class="row wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration=500ms><div class=col-xl-12><div class=social-icon><ul class=list-inline><li class=list-inline-item><a href=https://www.facebook.com/MetaMesh/><i class="fa fa-facebook-f"></i></a></li><li class=list-inline-item><a href=http://www.twitter.com/metameshwc><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li class=list-inline-item><a href=https://www.youtube.com/metameshwc><i class="fa fa-youtube"></i></a></li><li class=list-inline-item><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/meta-mesh-llc><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li></ul></div><div class="copyright text-center"><a class="navbar-brand p-0" href=https://www.metamesh.org/><img src=https://www.metamesh.org/images/logo.png alt="Meta Mesh Wireless Communities" height=42></a><br><p>Copyright © 2020 Meta Mesh Wireless Communities.
